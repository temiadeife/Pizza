# Pizza 

Cornmeal for baking sheet
Flour for surface
1 lb. pizza dough (thawed, if frozen)
3/4 c. marinara sauce
3 oz. mozzarella cheese, coarsely grated
2 tbsp. grated parmesan
Basil, for sprinkling

place a pizza stone in the oven and heat oven to 500ºF (if you can’t heat oven this high without broiling, set to 475ºF). 

Dust a baking sheet with cornmeal.

On a lightly floured surface, shape pizza dough into a 14- to 16-in oval or circle and place on prepared sheet (make sure that the dough slides easily around the sheet, if not, add a bit more cornmeal). 

Spread sauce on dough, leaving a ½-in boarder all the way around and sprinkle with mozzarella and then Parmesan.

If using a stone, slide the pizza off the sheet onto the stone. Bake until crust is golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.

Sprinkle with basil just before serving, if desired.
